Simulating direct lined cache. 

I am reading about cache in computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective. The text showed some interesting examples where unordinary looping can actually improve temporal or spatial locality, utilize the cache more, and thus yield great speed. 

I will be simulating normal memory and fast cache using javascript. The speed difference is simulated with a simple `setTimeOut`.
